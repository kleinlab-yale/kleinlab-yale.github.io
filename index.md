# Welcome to KLAY

**Modeling scientific discovery. Molding therapeutic molecules.**

KLAY (Klein Lab @ Yale) uses X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy to model
the protein structures that dictate life, signaling, and cancer. Based in the Yale
Cancer Biology Institute, the Yale Cancer Center, and the Department of Pharmacology,
we integrate structural biology, biophysics, and cancer biology to transform molecular
structure into therapeutic insight.
